# Huvud 3D Printer toolhead board USB-PD

A very small 3D printer board for use on a direct drive toolhead. 
It is designed to be used with Klipper firmware.
Klipper has the awesome feature to be able to use multiple MCUs connected to the host over a (relatively) high latency connection. 
This version uses USB-PD instead of CAN as that hardware is becoming commodity. 
It runs at 20 V instead of 24 V, so fans are a little slower. 
24 V is technically possible with USB-PD EPR AVS, the hardware is currently more difficult to source.
